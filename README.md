# Road-Accident-Analysis
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze road accident data, highlighting key trends, high-risk zones, time-based patterns, and contributing factors. Enabled data-driven insights for better decision-making and safety improvements. 


🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using Power BI, aimed at identifying key patterns, high-risk conditions, and critical insights to aid in decision-making for public safety and urban planning.

Key Features & Insights:

 📊 Total Overview: Displays key metrics such as total accidents (209K), injuries (80K), fatal injuries (389), and intersection-related accidents (95.2%).
 🌞 Accidents by Light Conditions: Analyzed frequency based on daylight, darkness, dusk, and dawn to highlight visibility-related risk factors.
 ⏰ Time-based Trends: Interactive visualizations show accident and injury trends across different times of the day and days of the week.
 🌧️ Weather Conditions: Assessed accident frequency under various weather scenarios (clear, rainy, overcast), indicating environmental impacts.
 🛣️ Road Conditions: Evaluated accidents under dry, wet, icy, and unknown road conditions to understand infrastructure effects.
 📅 Yearly Growth Analysis: Visualized accident growth trends from 2013 to 2025, revealing spikes and declines in accident rates.
 📍 Reason for Accidents: Ranked contributing factors like speeding, improper lane usage, and failure to yield, with over 58K cases marked as “unable to determine.”
 🗓️ Daily Patterns: Heatmap of accident distribution by day and time helps pinpoint peak risk periods during the week.

Tools & Tech Used:

Power BI – for data modeling, interactive visualization, and DAX-based calculations
Power Query – for data transformation and cleaning
Excel / CSV – as the data source
Data storytelling – to derive actionable insights for urban safety improvements

This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can transform raw data into powerful insights for public safety strategies.
